# sample-specs

The aim of this project is to explore the functionality of furo.pro: https://furo.pro

It was created following the approach described in the Furo Quickstart Guide: https://furo.pro/docs/guides/quickstart/

Please note: furo install did not work as described in the Quickstart Guide, returning an error message: git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey). This is caused by a new security restriction of GitHub requiring a registered public key for SSH connections. Follow GitHub's instructions for generating an SSH key and adding the key to your GitHub account. After that, furo install is working fine.
